My name is Ran Qiao(乔然), and I am currently completing my PhD at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I am finding a postdoctoral position now.

I have been working on interfacial instabilities and hydrodynamics of multiphase flow under the advisor of Professor Ting Si (司廷) and Asscociate Professor Kai Mu (穆恺) since 2018 at the Department of Modern Mechanics, USTC. My research interests include the interfacial instabilities of liquid jets/films and wetting phenomena on microfibers or substrates. My research has equipped me with strong foundations in theoretical analysis of interfacial instabilities, numerical simulation of multiphase flow, and micro/nanofluid experiments.
