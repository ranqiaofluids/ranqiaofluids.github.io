My name is Ran Qiao, and I am currently completing my PhD at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

I have been working on interfacial hydrodynamics of micro/nanofluids under the advisor of Prof. Ting Si (司廷) and Assco. Prof. Kai Mu (穆恺) since 2018 at the Department of Modern Mechanics, USTC. My current research focuses on interfacial hydrodynamics and wetting phenomena on microfibers or substrates. My research has equipped me with strong foundations in theoretical analysis of interfacial hydrodynamics, multi-phase flow numerical simulation, and micro/nanofluid experiments.
