__1. On the instability of the non-isothermal liquid jet__
Linear temporal instability analysis of a liquid jet emerging into a stationary gas environment under a radial thermal field is carried out in this project. The basic temperature profiles are obtained by solving the heat conduction problem between the liquid jet and the surrounding gas. The normal mode method is utilized to solve the temporal evolution of small disturbance. The parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of controlling parameters on the jet instability. The energy budget method is employed to reveal the physical mechanism dominating the jet instability.
