__1. Hydrodynamics of droplets wetting on the solid substrate__

The hydrodynamics of droplets wetting on the solid substrate is investigated by numerical simulation. The development of droplet profiles is studied. The velocity distribution is obtained.

__2. Interfacial instability of liquid films on a fiber__

A theoretical framework based on the axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations is proposed via linear instability analysis to investigate the influence of inertia and slip on the instability of a liquid film on a fibre. Direct numerical simulations of the Navier–Stokes equations are then performed to further confirm the theoretical findings.
