permalink: /publication/2021-paper-3
excerpt: 'Nonspherical liquid metal microparticles (NLMs) show extraordinary potential in various applications due to their multifunctional and structural advantages. To one-step-produce shaped NLMs with high efficiency, high controllability, and free of template, a facile microfluidic strategy named rotary flow shearing (RFS) is reported. A high-speed viscous shearing flow is provided by two counter-rotating rotors in the carrier fluid, inducing continuous pinch-off of liquid metal flowing from a capillary tube positioned in face of the slit between two rotors. The realtime oxidation realizes the rapid solidification of the pinching neck and the liquid metal surface during the RFS process, resulting in massive NLMs. Different from other microfluidic methods, the RFS enables tunable shapes of NLMs, especially for working materials at high viscosities. The collected NLMs exhibit special electrostatic-responsive performances including translation, rotation, reciprocation, and lining up under the manipulation of an external electric field. Such NLMs can be promisingly used for the construction of novel micromotors and soft electronics.'
