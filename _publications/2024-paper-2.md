__Abstract__

Presynthesized perovskite quantum dots are very promising for making films with different compositions, as they decouple crystallization and filmformation processes. However, fabricating large-area uniform films using perovskite quantum dots is still very challenging due to the complex fluidic dynamics of the solvents. Here, we report a robust film-formation approach using an environmental-friendly binary-solvent strategy. Nonbenzene solvents, n-octane and n-hexane, are mixed to manipulate the fluidic and evaporation dynamics of the perovskite quantum dot inks, resulting in balanced Marangoni flow, enhanced ink spreadability, and uniform soluteredistribution. We can therefore blade-coat large-area uniform perovskite films with different compositions using the same fabrication parameters. White and red perovskite light-emitting diodes incorporating blade-coated films exhibit a decent external quantum efficiency of 10.6% and 15.3% (0.04 cm2), and show a uniform emission up to 28 cm2. This work represents a significant step toward the application of perovskite light-emitting diodes in flat panel solid-state lighting.
